# Universality Metering


## Reasons

    Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.[1]

The `Universality Metering` stands by the above spring of/for action. It is the quest and the question of a such `Universality Metering` to obtain a user-given, subjective number pertaining to the `universality` of a sentence, paragraph, or even a single word.


## Concept

Due to the highly sensitive, multi-dimensional matters of human (or general idea-based, that is, grounded in touch and sight) language, a single crisp number is only recommended as an introductive step into this valuation metric for the universability of a language entity:

</p>

A more advanced metric would be obtained using fuzzy numbers (types 1 and 2):

</p>

Or even a pluridimensional manner of valuation:

</p>

The dimensions could remain nameless, or could be given names like `clarity`, `expresiveness`, `poetry`, and so forth.
