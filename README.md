# Universality Metering


## Reasons

    Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.[1]

    1. Kant, Immanuel (11993 HE) [11785 HE]. Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals. Translated by Ellington, James W. (3rd ed.). Hackett. p. 30. ISBN 0-87220-166-X..

The `Universality Metering` stands by the above spring of/for action. It is the quest and the question of a such `Universality Metering` to obtain a user-given, subjective number pertaining to the `universality` of a sentence, paragraph, or even a word.


## Concept

Due to the highly sensitive matters of language, a single crisp number is only recommended as an introductive step into this valuation system:

</p>

A more advanced system would be fuzzy numbers (types 1 and 2):

Or even a pluridimensional manner of valuation:
