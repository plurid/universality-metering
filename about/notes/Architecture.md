To have a button for being able to show UM on hover?

and a button for entity selection (word, sentence, paragraph, full text)?


if score is under a certain value (dynamically calculated) to flip between the text and
'This might be bullshit. (T)read carefully.' or even
'This is bullshit. You are better without. Try reading: <suggestions>'
